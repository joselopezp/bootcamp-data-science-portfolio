    "### 1.1 Context\n",
    "\n",
    "University health departments face a recurring challenge: they have limited budgets for student wellness interventions but lack data-driven criteria to decide *where to invest*. Anecdotal evidence suggests that sleep deprivation, sedentary behavior, and poor nutrition affect academic outcomes — but without statistical evidence, resource allocation remains subjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study is commissioned by a **University Health & Wellbeing Department** seeking to:\n",
    "- Understand which lifestyle habits most strongly predict academic performance.\n",
    "- Quantify the magnitude and direction of those relationships.\n",
    "- Generate evidence-based recommendations for intervention design.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **ICI Perspective (Industrial Engineering lens):**  \n",
    "> Think of the university as a production system. The student is the process. Inputs are habits (sleep, exercise, diet, study time). The output is academic performance (exam score). Identifying which inputs have the highest leverage on the output is a classic **process optimization** problem — the same logic applied in mining operations to identify bottleneck variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Business Question\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Primary:** Which combination of student lifestyle habits (sleep, physical activity, diet, study time) most strongly predicts academic performance, and what is the estimated ROI of intervening on the highest-impact habit?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Secondary:** Are there statistically significant differences in academic performance across student subgroups (gender, part-time employment, parental education)?\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Phenomenon Under Study\n",
    "\n",
    "University students exhibit heterogeneous academic performance (exam scores ranging from 18 to 100). A significant portion of this variance is hypothesized to be explained by **modifiable lifestyle behaviors**: sleep duration, physical activity frequency, dietary quality, and daily study hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike socioeconomic or genetic factors, lifestyle behaviors are **actionable** — they can be targeted through university-led interventions at relatively low cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**The university cannot identify which student wellness interventions to prioritize** because there is insufficient statistical evidence linking specific lifestyle habits to academic outcomes in the student population. This leads to either:\n",
    "- Under-investment in high-impact habits (Type II error in decision-making), or\n",
    "- Over-investment in low-impact programs (resource waste — LEAN: *muda*).\n",
